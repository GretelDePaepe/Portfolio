## Smart Adverse Media App

In 2017 I participated in a kick starter project at Euroclear.  Together with a front-end developer, I prototyped what a smart Adverse Media App for KYC (Know Your Customer) purpose could look like.  We were invited to showcase our prototype in a pitch battle and were thrilled that the idea was well received and received funding to move forward.  My role as data scientist was to build the machine learning models for the tool.
