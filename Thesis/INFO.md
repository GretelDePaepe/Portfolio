# Thesis

For my thesis, I conducted a quantitative analysis of religious content in two major Belgian newspapers, regarded as on the opposite ends of the political spectrum, to test the degree of secularization in the media. The results of my analysis were published in several specialized small periodicals, such as “Kultuurleven” and “de Vloer”. This jump-started a lifelong passion for everything data and the analysis thereof.
