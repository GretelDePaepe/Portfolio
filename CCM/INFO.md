# Continuous Control Monitoring

From 2011 to 2017 I worked as a Senior Associate Data Analytics at ADIA. I was initially hired as a data analyst in ADIA to
write Continuous Control Monitoring (CCM) scripts using ACL and python. CCM scripts are fully automated, from accessing, preparing and
analyzing the data, to reporting on the exceptions. Access to the data varies from selecting Oracle and SQL server data to wrangling XML files, flat files or even PDF’s. Exceptions are automatically distributed via e-mail as well as stored in a SQL database for follow-up. I was quickly able to show value and soon I was bombarded with requests for additional scripts and ad hoc analysis. The scope also widened to include trend analysis and sampling using more statistical methods.

Due to the success of the CCM program, the management gave me the go ahead to build and
manage a data analysis team in 2014. During this period I was wearing two hats. While still being the main analyst writing and maintaining scripts and performing all sorts of analysis, I was also tasked with expanding the team and setting up formal processes.

In 2016 the team became a section in it’s own right, offering three services to the company: Data Analysis, CCM
and Visualizations. For the latter we use a BI tool called Yellowfin. We also incorporated machine learning methods (such as regression, classification and clustering) in our analysis.
