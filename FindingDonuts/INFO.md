# Finding Donuts

While at ADIA, I volunteered to work on a real estate big data project. The project was titled “Finding donuts in Portland”. In our prototype we used Python to scrape the web for data points of interest, which were then plotted onto a map. The idea is that when doing this over time, one can detect and ultimately predict transforming neighborhoods.

I have continued to explore the first project in my free time as a hobby:
