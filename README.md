### AdverseMediaApp
Usage of unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to build a smart adverse media app for Know Your Customer Purposes

### CCM


### ChatBot


### FindingDonuts
Real Estate Big Data prototype.  Collection of data from the web (scraping + APIs) into no-SQL database with the goal of analyzing and modeling the data to predict transforming neighborhoods 


### HealthCareHackaton


### RegTech
Usage of advanced analytics and machine learning methods to derive insights into the stock of federal regulations. 
The objective is in this notebook is 3-fold:
- Usage of unsupervised machine learning algorithm to find the Nearest Neighbors for regulations, aka regulations which show similar wording and therefore have a high likelihood to be of similar content.
- Linkage of the stock of federal regulations to industry sectors
- Identification of regulations which potentially use archaic language.
The idea is to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of some advanced analytics and AI ideas quickly in a 'garage' style mode. Throughout the objectives mentioned above, there is a focus on visualizing results in an appealing and intuitive manner.


### TaxSpyder
Web scraping tax records and parsing the downloaded PDFs so the data can be analysed.


### Thesis
For my thesis, I conducted a quantitative analysis of religious content in two major Belgian newspapers, regarded as on the opposite ends of the political spectrum, to test the degree of secularization in the media. The results of my analysis were published in several specialized small periodicals, such as “Kultuurleven” and “de Vloer”. This jump-started a lifelong passion for everything data and the analysis thereof.

### Word2Vec
Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. In this notebook we use Word2Vec to model the language used in Star Trek Deep Space Nine.
